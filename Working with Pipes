Pipes Are a form of nested lists.

--First we will load a data and then view it.

data("ToothGrowth")
View(ToothGrowth)

--filter the dataset and name it as 'filtered_tg'

filtered_tg <- filter(ToothGrowth, dose==0.5)
View filtered_tg

--sorting the dataset based on len

arrange(ToothGrowth, len)

--NESTED function is completely contained within another function. 

arrange(filter(ToothGrowth, dose==0.5), len)

--Using PIPES %>%
--essentials
Add the pipe operator at the end of each line of the piped operation, except the last one. 
Check the code after we have programmed our pipe.
Revisit the piped operation to check for parts of your code to fix.

filtered_toothgrowth <- ToothGrowth %<%
  filter(dose==0.5) %<%
  arrange(len)
